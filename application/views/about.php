					This assignment was developed for academic and learning purposes.
					The assignment was produced by TheFourMusketeers which consists of four team members: Duy Le, Jens Christiansen, Leon Ho, and Andrew Morishita.
					<br/><br/>
					The goals for this is to have a better understanding and comprehension on MVC design applications. Producing this application will help expand
					our knowledge on the creation and utilization on Models, Views, and Controllers. 
					<br/><br/>
					The project is using GitHub as version control to help manage
					and organize multiple versions of the projects developed by each member in the team.
					We will be given a grade for COMP4711 - Introduction to Internet Software Development based on the completion of the assignment.
